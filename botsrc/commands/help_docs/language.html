<b>{Language Configuration}</b>
{This bot is using an experimental localization engine that automatically translates the content into any language. You can change the language of your chat by the settings command or privately by the language command}

<i>{How do I change the language in my private chat?}</i>
<code>/language</code>

<i>{How do I change the language of my chat?}</i>
<code>/settings</code> > {Language}

<i>{What does strict localization do?}</i>
{Strict localization tells the bot to only respond in the configured chat language when commands are executed by another user, with this disabled the bot can respond in the user's configured language when they execute commands so for example if your bot is configured in English but the user executing the commands has configured the bot in spanish in private then the bot will respond to the user in Spanish.}

<i>{Sometimes this slows the bot down!}</i>
{This only happens when the bot didn't cache the localization data, this only happens once and the next it's fast.}
