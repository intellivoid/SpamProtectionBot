<b>{False Detections}</b>
{We don't regularly clear out false predictions, but here's what you should know about false positives.}

 - {They don't get you blacklisted, operators will use their best judgement when blacklisting people and one or two false positives will not enable this, so don't worry.}
 - {Not all spam is detected accurately, especially in foreign languages. We take the false positives to improve our spam prediction models.}
 - {If the spam prediction contains sensitive information that you want removed immediately, provide the link to the prediction or message hash and we'll remove it.}
